# CVS_Vaccine_Bot_Public
This twitter bot was written during the peak of the covid vaccine rollout when finding vaccination appointments was almost impossible. 

I initially wrote this to help me find appointments for my elderly parents, but once I realized how helpful it was for me, I modified it to use the Tweepy API so the general public could also benefit! 

Using Twitters own API, selenium(initially, but then dropped in favor of only HTTP requests), and HTTP requests, we checked CVS.com for available vaccination appointments every minute.
During it's peak, the bot had over 10,000 followers and helped many people find appointments in the state of New Jersey. 

Take a look on twitter! @NJCVSCovidVax
